Inspired by [Drew Thaler](https://twitter.com/drewthaler)'s simple [JavaScript Blacklist](http://homepage.mac.com/drewthaler/jsblacklist/) plugin for Safari, here is a Chrome extension that blocks scripts from loading from certain domains.

Right now it just blocks my personal hard-coded list.

## TODO

1. Add an options interface sorta like [chrome-jsblacklist](https://github.com/jou/chrome-jsblacklist) has but without the async issue
1. Submit to Chrome Store
1. (once API is stable) get rid of old active handler code and set persistent:false
